        <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <span>Beat the eggs: </span>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of
          salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of
          water or milk for a fluffier texture.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Heat the pan: </span>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium
          heat and add butter or oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Cook the omelette: </span>Once the butter is melted and
          bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly
          coat the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Add fillings (optional): </span>When the eggs begin to set at
          the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your
          chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Fold and serve: </span>As the omelette continues to cook,
          carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for
          another minute, then slide it onto a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span>Enjoy: </span>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if
          needed.
